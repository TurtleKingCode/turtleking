**ReadMe**
<br><br>

You are reading a ReadMe file created by a programming noob.<br>
I assure you, you should't be proud about that.  I should be proud that I'm even able to do anything.<br>
I have Git but I feel like not using the App.  I'd rather like to use GitHub instead of Git.<br>
For one thing it's online So I can access it anywhere anytime.<br>
And also, I feel it's easier to use.<br>
But then again, I'm a noob so don't take my opinion seriously.
<br>
I'mma gonna make one branch over here.<br>
I'mma gonna call it "TurtleKingCode-patch-1".
