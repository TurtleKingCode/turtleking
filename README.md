**ReadMe**


You are reading a ReadMe file created by a programming noob.<br>
(ms)I assure you, you should't be proud about that.  I should be proud that I'm even able to do anything
I have Git but I feel like not using the App.  I'd rather like to use GitHub instead of Git.
For one thing it's online So I can access it anywhere anytime.
And also, I feel it's easier to use.
But then again, I'm a noob so don't take my opinion seriously.
