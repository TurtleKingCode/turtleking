**ReadMe**
<br><br>

You are reading a ReadMe file created by a programming noob.<br>
I assure you, you should't be proud about that.  I should be proud that I'm even able to do anything.<br>
I have Git but I feel like not using the App.  I'd rather like to use GitHub instead of Git.<br>
For one thing it's online So I can access it anywhere anytime.<br>
And also, I feel it's easier to use.<br>
But then again, I'm a noob so don't take my opinion seriously.
<br>
I'mma gonna make one branch over here.<br>
I'mma gonna call it "TurtleKingCode-patch-1".

# Serious
<br>
Okay, I think It's time to start doing something.  I will begin to attach code.
<br>
The code I'm attaching is HTML, JS, and CSS
<br>
It was a Claculator I made during the Summer
<br>
I feel like it's the largest project I have ever embarked in.  And I have a lot of pride in it.  Again, it was made by a noob so don't think highly of it.
<br>
Even if it looks "okay" keep in mind that it was made by a noob and that noobs can only make noob quality work.  That is as far as my expertiese goes.
<br>
<br>
* ***Note***
<br>
Just so you know, "noob" refers to newbe.  It means "a person who is inexperienced in a particular sphere or activity."
<br>
I'm doing this just so you know and just in case you don't get any ideas otherwise.
