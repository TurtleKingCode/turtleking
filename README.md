**ReadMe**
<br><br>

You are reading a ReadMe file created by a programming noob.<br>
I assure you, you should't be proud about that.  I should be proud that I'm even able to do anything.<br>
I have Git but I feel like not using the App.  I'd rather like to use GitHub instead of Git.<br>
For one thing it's online So I can access it anywhere anytime.<br>
And also, I feel it's easier to use.<br>
But then again, I'm a noob so don't take my opinion seriously.
<br>
I'mma gonna make one branch over here.<br>
I'mma gonna call it "TurtleKingCode-patch-1".

# Serious
<br>
Okay, I think It's time to start doing something.  I will begin to attach code.
<br>
The code I'm attaching is HTML, JS, and CSS
<br>
It was a Claculator I made during the Summer
<br>
I feel like it's the largest project I have ever embarked in.  And I have a lot of pride in it.  Again, it was made by a noob so don't think highly of it.
<br>
Even if it looks "okay" keep in mind that it was made by a noob and that noobs can only make noob quality work.  That is as far as my expertiese goes.
<br>
<br>
**Note**
<br>
Just so you know, "noob" refers to newbe.  It means "a person who is inexperienced in a particular sphere or activity."
<br>
I'm doing this just so you know and just in case you don't get any ideas otherwise.

# Info
While adding the files, I remembered that I used a JS library in my code.  I used the math.js library in my Javscript Code
<br>
Math.js did all the HardCore math and calculations
<br>
The Majority of my javascript code was responsible for making the buttons responsive and for shuffling around and organizing the data receved when you press each button, what happens when and what you see.
<br>
In short, it set everything up while Math.js did the calculating.
<br>
I don't know how to add a library to GitHub
<br>
So I'll send you a link to it's site.
<br>
<a href="mathjs.org">Mathjs.org</a>
